# php-test-assignment

Remarks:
1. Created my own tool for handling ISO8601 durations as original DateInterval from PHP doesn't seem to support second fractions.
2. I've written some unit tests even though it wasn't required. These tests are in no means a complete set - I was using them to only verify if certain crucial parts of the code work as they supposed to.
