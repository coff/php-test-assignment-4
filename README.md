# php-test-assignment

Remarks:
1. Created my own tool for handling ISO8601 durations as original DateInterval from PHP doesn't seem to support second fractions
2. Written tests even though it wasn't required in the task. These tests are in no means a complete set - I was using them to only verify if certain crucial parts of the code works as it's supposed to.
